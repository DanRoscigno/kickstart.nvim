# This is to reverse the .gitignore in the ClickHouse-docs repo, as
# the marksman LSP ignores dirs in the .gitignore when checking
# for links for markdown files.  This file (.ignore) gets processed
# after .gitignore, so the negation (`!`) of the path fixes the issue
# created by copying the files into the clickhouse-docs directory
# structure

# place at root dir of the markdown project, for example:
# $GITHUB/clickhouse-docs/.ignore
